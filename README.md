# DiagAI
DiagAI is a web application designed for rapid disease diagnosis based on symptoms and signs input.
This first version of the application utilizes a neural network model that predicts the likelihood of malaria based on the selected symptoms or signs.
You can select symptoms or signs you are experiencing, and the model will provide you with a probable diagnosis for malaria.
